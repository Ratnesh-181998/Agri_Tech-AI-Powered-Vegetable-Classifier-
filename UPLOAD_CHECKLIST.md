# 🚀 GitHub Upload Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your project is 100% ready for GitHub.

## 📁 File Structure
- [ ] **README.md**: Is it clear, descriptive, and formatted correctly?
- [ ] **.gitignore**: Does it exclude `__pycache__`, `.ipynb_checkpoints`, and large data folders (`ninjacart_data/`)?

- [ ] **LICENSE**: Is the MIT License included?
- [ ] **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Are contribution guidelines present?

## 🧹 Code Cleanup
- [ ] **Notebooks**: Did you clear outputs in Jupyter notebooks (optional, but keeps diffs clean)?
- [ ] **Comments**: Are there helpful comments in the code?
- [ ] **Hardcoded Paths**: Did you remove any absolute paths (e.g., `C:\Users\Name\...`) and replace them with relative paths?
- [ ] **Secrets**: Ensure no API keys or passwords are in the code.

## 🧪 Functionality
- [ ] **Setup Script**: Does `setup_env.bat` run without errors?
- [ ] **Data**: Is the data folder structure documented (since data itself is gitignored)?

## 📤 Upload Process

## 🎨 Final Polish
